### Key Points About `useState`

1. **Initialization**:
    - `useState` takes an initial state as an argument and returns an array containing two elements:
        - The current state.
        - A function that updates the state.
2. **State Management**:
    - You can use the state and the state update function to manage and manipulate state within your component.
