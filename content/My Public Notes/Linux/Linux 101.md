### Linux Introduction

- Linux is a free and open source UNIX-liike operating system initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991
- It started as a system for intel x86-based PCs and has grown to become one of the most widely used operating systems worldwide
- Known for its robustness, security, and flexibility; linux is used in everything from personal computers to the most powerful supercomputers
- Linux is highly versatile, running devices from smartphones to servers and supporting a global community that continues to develop and adapt it for various needs
- That adaptibility and open-source nature have made linux a fundamental technology in modern computing
- using linux starting up a world 

### Linux Distributions

- It comes in various distributions, each tailored for different uses such as servers, desktops, and embedded devices. Some popular are:

	1. Ubuntu = Highly user-friendly, ideal for beginners and desktop users
	2. Fedora = Features the latest technologies, preferred by developers
	3. centOS = Stable and supported, ideal for servers, aligned with red hat enterprise linux
	4. Debian = Known for its stability and as a foundation for other distributions like ubuntu
	5. Arch linux = Simple and continuously updated, favored by tech enthusiast

### Linux File System

- generally
	- It organized in a hierarchical manner
	- Starting at the root directory ("/"), from which various key directories branch out, each serving distinct purposes

- some key directories:
	- `/bin` and `/sbin` = holds essential user and system binaries
	- `/etc` = Contains system configuration files
	- `/var` = stores varaiable data like logs
	- `/home` = includes personal user directories

- example linux file types:
	- `Ext4`: ideal for large files, widely use for its reliability
	- `XFS`: Optimized for performance and scalability
	- `BTRFS` =supports feature like snapshotting and volume management


### Linux Networking

- networking is a crucial component of linux,essential for effective system communication and security

	- configuration tools:
		- `ifconfig/ip` = manage network interface settings
		- `netstat` = tracks network connection and statistics

	- SSH for secure access
		- `ssh` = Provides secure command-line access to remote systems
	
	- network security
		- `iptables/FirewallID` = used to set up, maintain, and isnpect the tables of IP packet filter rules in the linux kernel

- these  tools are fundamental for managing network interactions, ensuring both connectivity and security in linux environment

### Linux Security

- Security is fundamental to linux
- key security features:
	- **User permissions**: control access with read, write, and execute privileges for owners, groups, and others
	- **Enhanced security with SELinux**: Offers detailed control over system resources access
	- Security extensions:
		- **AppArmor**: Manages program capabilities with specific security profiles
		- **Firewalls**: Utilizes iptables or FirewallID to guard againts unathorized intrusions
- these features ensure guaranteed protection across linux environment

### Linux in cloud computing

- its essential in cloud computing for its stability and flexibility.
- how it fits into the cloud?
	- **Preferred platform**: linux is favored for cloud servers for its strong security and performance
	- **container ecosystem**: supports docker and kubernetes for efficient cloud application management
	- **automation tools**: seamlessly integrates with ansible and terraform for simple cloud operations
	- **universal support**: widely used by major cloud providers like aws, azure, and google cloud, which optimize their service around linux capabilities
