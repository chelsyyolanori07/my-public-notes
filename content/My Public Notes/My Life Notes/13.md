## Who is a real warrior? Through my eyes perspective

Sometimes one of the most beautiful souls and the softest hearts you'll ever meet is someone who experienced so much in life and turmoil in their lifetime.
They had to weather relentless storms before finding the peace that now rests within them.
It took them a lot of time to heal while putting that smily face so that others can believe they're fine.
It took them countless prayers and tears every time they're alone in their room; no one can see how much they're trying their best just to still be here today.
Every scar they carry tells a story of survival, a testament to their courage, and proof that even in the face of darkness, they chose to fight for their light even though they sometimes struggling siently.
And even when the world doesn't notice, their light quietly shines, illuminating paths for others, proving that resilience is the most profound kind of beauty.
I just hope beautiful things happen to them, and more importantly, when they do, I hope they will feel that they're worthy of them.
They're the real warrior, and I hope they know that they're not alone.
