## Reasons Why I Admire Calm People

Honestly I really admire and love calm people, the ones that choosing their words wisely, never raising their voice and listening before   
they speak up about things

They are not living this life to show off but to exist in a quiet and   
harmony way, they are down to earth and humble about their life and then they are the kind of people that still feeling okay even though they are being misunderstood by a lot of people's opinions

They are patient with themselves and whatever things happened that didn't go their way but still choose to trust God's timing and God's plan for them and every time when life gets tough or really heavy they will cry behind the closed door and wipe their tears alone while saying and   
believe that "Everything is going to be okay, why would God bring me this far to leave me?" so they choose to keep going and not give up, most of the time they are the one who offering help to someone   
who might need it and try to help them as they can even sometimes they are struggling silently too, they forgive themselves even people easily

They always grateful for everything they have and didn't judge other people so quickly or said bad things about them even behind their back, they choose kindness as part of what makes them human not as a weakness and trying to at least not hurt or harm anyone with what they are doing or what they are saying, honestly in the end of the day   
that's what the kind of people I want to become

It maybe sounds not that fancy, great or cool also I'm still so far from these things and there are so many things I need to learn but honestly   
I find those kind of people really inspiring
