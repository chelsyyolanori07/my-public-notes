## Read this when you think you so far behind in life

A gentle reminder that if you feel like you're so far behind in life right now, remember that the truth is it could be that you're not really far behind. Just like a tree, your 'roots' are sinking deep into the earth. God is preparing you to be strong enough to weather the storm that may comes your way. He makes you stronger so that your shade can be a shelter and your fruits can be gift for all. Keep growing, even if not upwards, growing downwards that makes you a better and stronger person is also called growth

You have all the time in your life life to become all you want to be in this world, even though it might seem slow as long as you don't give up i am sure it will be worth it in the end. Even if you sometimes feel like you have no idea where exactly life will take you, I hope you can always hold on to that tiny hope that one day you will be able to live the life you have always wanted. God sees how hard and how much you are trying your best, and i think that's already more than enough, surely He will never let you down lastly please don't forget to take care of yourself. I said this reminder for my own self too
