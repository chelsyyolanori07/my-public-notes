## Acceptance

The older I get, the more I realize that surviving in life isn’t all about positivity. The first thing we need is acceptance—accepting that sometimes things don’t go our way, we make mistakes, have bad days, feel lost and confused, and we all struggling at times. And that’s okay. In the end this is me, with all my flaws, learning as I go, because it’s my first time living in this world—and that’s okay. Only after acceptance i think comes positivity, which it doesn’t mean you should being happy all the time, but trusting that even in the hardest moments, better days will come, and you will be okay...
