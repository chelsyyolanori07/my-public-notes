## Forgive

Whenever i feel upset with my family, people, the world or even myself i always try to remember that it's my first time and their first time living in this world too. So, I believe it's one of the reasons I would strive to let go that feeling immediately and forgive easily. They say this is not a good thing, but I do it that way because that heavy feeling doesn't have to be something I carry with me everywhere I go. It also might sounds a bit sad, and looks like i hurt my own self but every time I do it, somehow it heals some part of me that I don't know I needed
