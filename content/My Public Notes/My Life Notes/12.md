## It's okay

Dear myself, you don't have to be afraid of losing something in a world where nothing in this world is actually belongs to you. If God wants something to be yours, it will always find its way , no matter how impossible it seems. So breathe deeply, trust your lil life journey, follow your heart, and keep moving forwardâ€”you will be okayy
