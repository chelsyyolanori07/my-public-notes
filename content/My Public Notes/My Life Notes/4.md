## Everything is Going to Be Alright and You Will Be okay

I just want to say a gentle reminder  that no matter how hard life it seems right now all your pain, unseen sadness, silent life battles,  
struggles, problems, that you are facing right now will all end eventually, it will not not last forever. 

We just need to keep going even though we don't know when to stop also please remember that every cloud  has silver lining, at the end of the night is the dawn, spring comes after winter, and the flowers begin to bloom.Sometimes there are time when you already done your best but you didn't get what you want. There will be days when you feel really exhausted, and when you feel this be patient with yourself cuz nothing in nature blooms all year

Life is a journey not a race so please keep going at your own pace I believe that everything will fall into places in the right time and in case no one said this to you today this week or this month I just want to say I really really proud of you for everything you do to keep going and to choose exist in this world you really are a strong and a great human being just by existing and still be here.. Thank you for being alive
