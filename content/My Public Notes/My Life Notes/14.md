## A little life lesson from the river

When I look into the river, it somehow teaches me that moving forward isn’t about rushing but about flowing with purpose. It’s not about forcing things, but embracing the journey, trusting that life will carry us there—carry us to where we are meant to be

"Chill on a ship with an unfamiliar captain, chill on a plane with an unfamiliar pilot so why not chill in life trusting God's got your back?" I hope this words can give someone or you strength to keep going, to take it one step at a time and if that's still hard please try to take it one breathe at a time but one thing for sure is you should not give up no matter how dark and stuck it will get because you have God who will never leave you alone, He sees you are trying your best and i think it's already more than enough..  

You're alive for a reason and the things that happened to you all happen for a reason even the things that we don't like but good things can come unexpectedly. Like one of my favorite saying that i will keep for the rest of my life which is "When you get what you want, that's God's direction and when you didn't get what you want, that's God's protection" and another my favorite saying is "When you feel like you are in the dark and being buried, it's actually because you're being planted" Sometimes the most beautiful flowers are the ones that take time to grow. Don't be afraid if you move slower compared to others, life is a journey not a race so keep going at your own pace.. Someday you will bloom not because you want to prove it to other people but because you deserve to know how does it feel to not give up on myself feels like.. Please always remember that 

I said that for myself too :))
