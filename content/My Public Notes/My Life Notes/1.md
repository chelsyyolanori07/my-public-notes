## Dear Myself

Dear myself, 

Let your heart guides you
It whispers, so listen closely
Put God first so that He will take care of you
Be kind because that's what the world needs the most 
Right now, you probably don't know how exactly your life is going to be in the future, but live it gently so that you don't have any regrets.  
You don't have to be the greatest, you don't have to be the smartest, you don't have to be perfect
You just have to try to do better than your own self before a little by little
Life is a journey, not a race, so keep going in your own pace
Don't give up on your dreams, not because you want to prove it to other people, but because you deserve to know how does it feel to not give up on my dreams feels like.  
Lastly, allow yourself to shine without the desire to be seen
Please always remember that
