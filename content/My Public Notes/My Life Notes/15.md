and it hits you on a random October evening that self respect is lonelier than you imagined, but lighter than you've ever felt. 

and it hits you on a random October evening that you've spent years calling exhaustion "strength".

and it hits you on a random October evening that every "someday" quietly expires while you wait to feel ready.

and it hits you on a random October evening that no one actually know what they're doing, some just hide it better.

and it hits you on a random October evening that you don't crave attention anymore, you just want to be understood without performing for it.

and it hits you on a random October evening that growing up mostly means making peace with unanswered questions.

and it hits you on a random October evening that we spend more time managing people's perceptions than living your own truth.

and it hits you on a random October evening that we suffer more in imagination than reality.

and it hits you on a random October evening that how deep someone who said "close the window that hurts you no matter how beautiful the view is".

and it hits you on a random October evening that you started recognizing yourself the day you stopped pleasing everyone else.

and it hits you on a random October evening that how much life happen, a few years ago you found yourself crying while hoping everything to get better and somehow those pain slowly gone and you found yourself smiling right now in one random Sunday evening.

and it hits you on a random October evening that peace is not the reward, it's the consequences of finally running out from the chaos to chase.

and it hits you on a random October evening that there's big difference between being interested in something and being committed in what we are doing.

and it hits you on a random October evening that a sign you healing is you start to romanticize life again. You notice sunlight spilling across your window. You feel your own laughter. You slow down enough to taste your favorite drink, to watch the rain, to actually be present. It's not about life being perfect, it's about feeling safe enough in your own body to see the beauty again.

and it hits you on a random October evening that "you all have a little bit of 'i want to change the world' in you, but i hope you know that it's okay if you only save one person, and it's okay if that person is you" i feel liike a few people i know could stand to read this.

and it hits you on a random October evening that acceptance is peace.

and it hits you on a random October evening that you deserve a love that makes you softer, not smaller. The kind that not makes you question your own worth, but instead the kind that brings you back to yourself. Love that doesn't just want the best part of you, but still choosing you even they already see the messy and unfiltered part of you. That is the kind of love that should everyone deserve.

and it hits you on a random October evening that i finally understand how deep when someone said "the more you know yourself, the more patience you have for what you see in others"
