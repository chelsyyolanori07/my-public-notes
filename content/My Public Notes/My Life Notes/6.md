## Listen to this when you are overthinking

Sometimes ourself can play this nasty trick on us that thinking that we are not good enough and then what will happen in the future, so on.. honestly sometimes i feel that too so yeahh this is a reminder for my own self too

For someone who feeling a lil bit off lately and worried about what's going to happen in the future let's take a deep breathe for a moment. I think overthinking is something that is probably hard for us to avoid but i hope this can calm our mind a lil bit whenever we're overthinking.

I come across a video on the internet and in that video this person is asked me:

I have a question for you
What  if it turns out better than you could ever imagined?
What if all of the changes that you are making in your life right now are leading to something more beautiful than you could ever invisioned?
Yes, things could go wrong
Yes, things could go sideways
But they could also turn into a beautiful miracle
You don't know...
Please just remember this when you're overthinking or doubting something what if it turns out better than we coukd ever imagine?
Cause it might..

Also i think for me the other medicine or cure of overthinking is trusting God's plan and His timing more. Everything in our lives happens for a reason, even the things that we think didn't work out. There's a quote that i will try to remember for the rest of my life it said 

"When you get what you want, that's God's direction and when you didn't get what you want, that's God's protection"

So please try to keep thinking positive even though honestly it's really hard to always keep it that way but i believe God will never leave you empty handed, because He loves you and will never leave you alone and always got your back no matter what happens as long as you believe and honestly for me i think trusting God is the only reason i choose to keep going and made it this far

The third thing that i think can calm down overthingking is by doing what you can do now, don't focus on the whole staircase but just focus on the step in front of you and in the end i just want to say keep going and don't give up, it's okay to take a break for a while when you feel it's too overwhelming cause i always think that life is not a race after all, life is a journey, no one is too early or too late, everyone just on their own time so yeahh i hope you can be patient with yourselves

I think as long as you are trying it's already more than enough, i am so proud of you for everything you do or even just simply exist in the world.. and as always thank you so much for still be here
