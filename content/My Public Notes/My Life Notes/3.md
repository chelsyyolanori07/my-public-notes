## You Are Matter in This World

Honestly I just noticed that everybody looks alright until you have a deep conversation with them and then I realized that some people right now are probably struggling to survive through smiling face and I'm fine sentence. They fight their own silent battles without anyone knows also I believe that some people in this world right now requires twice the courage they usually need to just exist these days

No one pats them on the back but they are actively fighting something   
I really hope that that they can conquer the demons that hide behind those tired eyes and I hope everything will be alright for them also I just want to say that don't give up on your life because you are valuable, you are important, you are valid and your worth is immeasurable and in the end I just hope that God can give them a wonderful life. Once again keep going cuz you are greater than you think you are
