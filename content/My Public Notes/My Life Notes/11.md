## Be careful..

Lately I've been thinking, it doesn't matter who you are or how great you are cause people tend to mostly forget many things but they will always remember one thing which is how you made them feel with your words and actions, those are the things that will stick with people forever. 

That's another one of the reasons to be kind and gentle in this world even though sometimes it's hard to do that, don't be the reason someone crying in silence at night before they fall asleep, don't be the reason someone skip their meal, didn't eat, hate waking up in the morning, can't sleep at night, feels left out, or carrying heavy wounds in their heart just because of the things you said. 

More importantly bring that gentleness wherever you go because we never know who hiding behind the smile or behind those profile picture we see on the internet. Just know that you make a world a beautiful place even though what you do is just a lil act of kindness; cause kindness has a quiet power to change lives whether we realized it or not and it sits quitly above all things. I said this for myself too.
