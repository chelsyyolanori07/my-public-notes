## Don't worry you will be okay
 
I just want to say a gentle reminder that for anyone who carrying a heavy heart lately, feeling left behind and all the pain and silent life battles you told no one about just because you don't want to be a burden i hope it's all going to be okay

Just remember that God sees everything, God sees your tears in the middle of the night when you don't have anyone to talk about all your problems with, God knows how hard you try, and He is the only one who will never leave you alone.. Even though it seems dark right now take a deep breathe for a while close your eyes for a moment and remind yourself that why God already bring you this far to leave you? I think the only thing that will make our chest lighter is the faith we got to trusting God's plan and timing

Cause when your intention is pure i am sure He will provide a way no matter how seems impossible it is keep going cause as long as you don't lose your trust in God miracle can still happen, He can make a way when and open door that you uthink will be close forever 

Once again keep going bud and i am really proud of you for everything you do and still be here, you really are a strong and amazing human being no one can tell you otherwise even though you think you don't think you are. You choose to keep going and exist in world is already something great to be proud of.. So in case no one said this to you today i just want to say i am so proud of you
