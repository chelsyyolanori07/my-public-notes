- Design in 4 words - IPPI
    - Problem solving
    - Inspiration
    - Rules
    - Iteration (Repetitive process of refining and improving a product, service, or system through cycles of testing, evaluation, and modification)

- what? 
    - *Therapist* that *remixes* w *standardized* iteration based on an identity to create and/or apply *visual systems*
        - Words meaning
            - *Therapist* - eradicate the root problem trough communication
            - *remixing* - inspiration from many others 
            - *standardized* - backed up from objective styling best practices
            - *visual systems* - like branding and style guidelines****

## Fundamental Principle of Design
### 1. Contrast
- **Contrast** is the difference between two or more elements in a design.
- It makes certain parts stand out and grabs the viewer's attention. 
- Contrast can be achieved through differences in color, size, shape, texture, and more. 
- For example, using a light color text on a dark background creates contrast and makes the text easier to read.
### 2. Balance
- **Balance** is about distributing elements evenly in a design to create a sense of stability. 
	There are two main types of balance:
	- **Symmetrical Balance:** Elements are arranged evenly around a central point or axis. It creates a formal, orderly look.
	- **Asymmetrical Balance:** Elements of different sizes, shapes, or colors are arranged in a way that still feels balanced but is more dynamic and interesting.

    #### Sizes, Colors, Spaces
    - **Sizes:** Varying the size of elements can create visual interest and hierarchy (importance). 
    - **Colors:** Using different colors to create a sense of balance. For example, balancing a bright color with a more neutral one.
    - **Spaces:** Ensuring that there is enough white space (empty space) around elements to avoid clutter and improve readability.
### 3. Iterated at least 2 times
- Iteration is the process of repeating cycles of design, testing, and refining to improve the final product.
- Each iteration involves revising and improving the design based on feedback or new ideas.
### 4. Spacing
- **Spacing** (or white space) is the empty space around and between elements in a design. 
- Proper spacing helps to avoid clutter and makes the design easier to navigate and understand. 
- It gives elements room to breathe and improves overall readability.
### 5. Alignment
- **Alignment** is how elements are lined up in a design. 

	Proper alignment creates order and helps guide the viewer's eye through the design. There are several types of alignment:
	- **Left alignment:** Text or elements are aligned to the left margin.
	- **Right alignment:** Text or elements are aligned to the right margin.
	- **Center alignment:** Text or elements are centered within the space.
	- **Justified alignment:** Text is aligned evenly along the left and right margins.
### 6. Placement
- **Placement** refers to where elements are positioned within a design.
- Good placement helps to create a clear visual flow and ensures that important elements are easily noticed by the viewer.
### 7. Typography
- **Typography** is the art and technique of arranging text. 
- It involves choosing fonts, font sizes, line spacing, and letter spacing. 
- Good typography enhances readability and helps convey the design's message effectively. 

	Key aspects of typography include:
	- **Font choice:** Selecting fonts that match the tone and purpose of the design.
	- **Hierarchy:** Using different font sizes and styles to show the importance of different text elements (e.g., headings, subheadings, body text).
	- **Readability:** Ensuring that text is easy to read by choosing appropriate fonts, sizes, and line spacing.
### 8. Consistency
- **Consistency** means using the same design elements throughout the design to create a cohesive and unified look. 
- This includes consistent use of colors, fonts, spacing, and styles. 
- Consistency helps to create a professional and polished appearance and makes the design easier to understand and navigate.

- wireframing = to focus on the content and the structure you want to put on your design before jumping into the design software and designing your own design
- method: pen and paper (simple) just sketch it there and take it to computer
- method 2: using design software but make it simple but still can comminicate what's going to be there
