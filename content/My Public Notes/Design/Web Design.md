- Web designer = someone who in charge in designing front-end(everything that user can see and interact with) of the web 
- Web developer = someone who is in charge in back-end developer
- UX (user experience) designer = responsible making sure it's user friendly, exemple: how the content structure on the website , etc
- UI (user interface) designer = responsible for user interface/appearance of the project, how that wesite gonna look like and considering the UX notes (fonts, colors, etc) visual appearance of the project
### Project Brief
- Be clear about what you're making and who are making it for
- Be as detailed as posssible and include that in the brief
- example:
1. About the client 
2. Logo
3. Website structure (example: Homepage, about me, contact) -> ask chat gpt
4. Website content
### Wireframes
- you can call it sketch that focus on the displaying the content and structures (low-fidelity version of the final design)
- doesn't have to care about aesthetic/make it fancy

### Design Tools
- for UI design avoid photoshop and illustrator and focus on using a more appropriate app
- Use figma for now

### Color theory
- there are primary color (red, blue, yellow)
- secondary color (get by mixing the primary color)

- tertiary color (combining primary and tertiary color)

- color terminology
	- hue - reference the dominant color
	- tint - mixing the color with white (easily do it by moving the color cursor into white area)
	- shade - mixing the color with black (darker version of the hue)
	- tone - mixing pure color/hue with grey
	- saturation - how rich or dull the color
	- brightness - just see you choose the color closer to white/bright or into darker side near black
	- color temperature - cool color is blue, purple to the right and warm color is from the other side to the left (yellow, etc)

- color model
	- cmyk = cyan, magenta, yellow, black used in printing
	- rgb = red, green, blue (it's basically just mixing these 3 colors to get new colors) used in digital media
		- red = 255, 0, 0
		- green = 0, 255, 0
		- blue = 0, 0, 255
		- white = 255, 255, 255
		- black = 0, 0, 0
		- new color just adjust it as you can using color picker
	- hsb = hue, saturation, brigthness used in digital media
		- hue = scale 0 - 360 (these all different colors)
		- saturation = how pure that color is 100 is full saturation
		- brighness = 100 it will be really bright
	- hex = hexadecimal; friendlier way to displaying rgb color
		- first 2 letters/numbers refer to red
		- next 2 refer to green
		- last 2 refer to blue

- color harmonies
	- color harmonies allow you to easily create color pallete for your project
	- you can use color pallete tool like adobe color
	- another useful tools when working with colors:
		- color space
		- color hunt
		- muzli color
		- web gradients
		- dribble
- a complementary color palette = will give most contrast
- monochromatic color = will give least contrast

### Creating a color pallete for the project









### Typography
- makes sure to understand the brand and the audience before choosing fonts 
- decide which fonts that will work best based on the message you want the website to convey
- free resource tools for fonts: google fonts (free)
- what style you want to choose?
- readability
- loading time
- font roles (what font will be used in what elements for example the heading what will you choose for the font, and the paragraph)
	- single typeface = all the elements will be using fonts from that family setting roles (easy)
	- multiple typefaces = use the font with the best readability for smaller elements (trickier)
- font attributes (size, weight, line height, etc)
