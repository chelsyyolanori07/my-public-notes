## My Little Letter for My Friends

So lately I listen to this song a lot called Scott Street by Phoebe Bridges. I'm so sorry if my pronunciation is wrong and this song become one of my favorite songs now, while I listening to this song it kind of   
reminds me of my friends in the past so yeah if one of you listening to this accidentally or I don't know I just want to say this little letter for you that probably I really cannot express it out loud  

This little letter is for my childhood, elementary   
school, middle school and high school best friends, honestly I don't have much friends but you are all I have as person I can called friends at the certain age. 

You all are a great human being so this song reminds me how does it feels to losing friends trust me it's one of the most heartbroken feelings in the world I just hope you all are doing fine there wherever you are...

I guess I'm still an awkward, quiet, stubborn, weird and silly human being that I am. 
I'm still  a mess but I'm trying my best as I can right now to figure my life out a little by little so just know that I never hate you I never will and can.

I think I'm still need some time and if the time is right hopefully I can have the courage to not be stranger and start everything right. I guess   
after all this time I become a ghost and keep everything that happens in my life inside, you might not notice it and in the end it turns out our friendship slowly becomes fades away but I think it's already supposed to be that way because I really don't want to burden anyone even   
my own family with my emotions or everything so I choose to keep all deep down inside.

Just know that I don't blame anyone or anything I just need some time right now until I feel ready again and if that's happen my comeback will be personal and it's also because it's an apology to myself.   

Anyway just know that I appreciate each one of you and I just can pray for you all in the distance right now..

I'm so sorry once again for disappearing for a while like this and I really hope all of  you will have a wonderful life and don't forget to take care of yourself.. 

Honestly this probably has been one year since I decided to become a ghost so once again to all my friends in the past I  really am sorry and thank you so much for everything..
