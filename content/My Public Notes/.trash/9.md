## Don't forget to live

This is just a reminder "Don't forget to live today.."

I know it sounds simple but i think we forgot this too often
We're too caught up in the world and in our mind 
We're so distracted from the very life for trying to find
Because we tell ourselves that we will start enjoying life when we have built one like one we don't hate
